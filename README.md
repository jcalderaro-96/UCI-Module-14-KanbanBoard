# Kanban Board with JWT Authentication

## Overview

This project is a Kanban board application that includes secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The application features:

- A login page for user authentication.
- Secure API endpoints that require a valid JWT for access.
- A Kanban board displaying tasks sorted into three columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done.
- Client-side JWT storage in `localStorage` for secure and persistent authentication.

This project was completed as part of a full-stack challenge to demonstrate skills in authentication, Express APIs, and full-stack deployment.

## Challenge User Story

**As a member of an agile team,**  
I want a Kanban board with a secure login page  
**so that** I can securely access and manage my work tasks.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

‚úÖ The login page provides form inputs for username and password.  
‚úÖ Users with valid credentials receive a JWT and are redirected to the main Kanban board.  
‚úÖ Invalid login attempts display an error message.  
‚úÖ On successful login, the JWT is stored in `localStorage`.  
‚úÖ Logging out removes the JWT from `localStorage` and redirects to the login page.  
‚úÖ API requests to protected routes require a valid JWT.  
‚úÖ Inactive users will have their JWT expire and must log in again.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend:** Express, Node.js, Sequelize ORM, PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcrypt for password hashing
- **Deployment:** Render (for both server and client)

---

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22+)
- PostgreSQL database
- Environment variables configured in a `.env` file.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jcalderaro-96/UCI-Module-14-KanbanBoard
   cd UCI-Module-14-KanbanBoard

2. **Install dependencies for the server and client:**
cd server && npm install
cd ../client && npm install

3. **Configure environment variables:**
Create a .env file in the server directory with:
- DB_NAME='kanban_db'
- DB_USER='your_db_username'
- DB_PASSWORD='your_db_password'
- JWT_SECRET_KEY='supersecretjwtkey123!'

4. **Run the application locally:**
- npm start

## Deployment Status
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: While the application was deployed to Render, there was a database connection issue (ECONNREFUSED) that prevented the app from running correctly in the deployed environment.
- The server and client apps were successfully built and uploaded to Render.
- The PostgreSQL database was not connecting properly in Render.
- Locally, the application runs as expected with JWT authentication and client-side token storage.

## Screenshots
